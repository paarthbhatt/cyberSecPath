## 🔎 Detailed Task Summaries

### 1️⃣ Introduction to Defensive Security
- Defines the core mission: protecting assets from unauthorized access and threats.
- Contrasts with Offensive Security (Red Team).

### 2️⃣ Areas of Defensive Security
- **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: The frontline monitoring team.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Strategic knowledge about attackers.
- **Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)**: The "CSI" of cyber security.
- **Malware Analysis**: Dissecting viruses and ransomware.

### 3️⃣ Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Explains the daily life of a SOC analyst.
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**: The central tool for aggregating logs and alerts.
- Monitoring for suspicious activity (e.g., failed logins, strange network traffic).

### 4️⃣ Threat Intelligence
- **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**: Collecting data from open sources (OSINT) and private feeds.
- Understanding TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) of threat actors.
- Using this info to update firewall rules and detection signatures.

### 5️⃣ Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)
- **Forensics**: Preserving evidence, analyzing disk images and memory dumps.
- **Incident Response**: The lifecycle of handling a breach (Preparation -> Detection -> Containment -> Eradication -> Recovery -> Lessons Learned).
- Chain of custody importance.

### 6️⃣ Malware Analysis
- **Static Analysis**: Examining code without running it (strings, hashes).
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Running malware in a sandbox to observe behavior.
- Understanding payloads like Ransomware, Trojans, and Spyware.

### 7️⃣ Conclusion
- Recaps the various career paths in defensive security.
- Encourages further learning in the "Cyber Defense" path.
