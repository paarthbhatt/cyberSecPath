### 2️⃣ Evaluation of Search Results
- Teaches how to distinguish between reliable official documentation and potentially misleading forums or outdated blogs.
- Emphasises checking the date, author, and domain reputation.

### 3️⃣ Search Engines

- **VirusTotal** – Search for file hashes to see if they are malicious.
- **Censys** – Another tool for internet-wide scanning and asset discovery.

### 5️⃣ Vulnerabilities and Exploits
- How to find specific vulnerabilities using:
  - **CVE** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) IDs.
  - **NVD** (National Vulnerability Database).
  - **Exploit-DB** for proof-of-concept code.

### 6️⃣ Technical Documentation
- The importance of "RTFM" (Read The Manual).
- How to use `man <command>` in Linux.
- Navigating vendor documentation (Microsoft Docs, Red Hat, etc.).

### 7️⃣ Social Media
- Using platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit for gathering intelligence.
- Searching for usernames, leaked info, or real-time threat updates.

### 8️⃣ Conclusion
- Summarises the key takeaways:
  - Verify your sources.
